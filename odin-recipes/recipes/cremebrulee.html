        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Whisk together cream and 3 tablespoons sugar in a microwave-safe 
                bowl until combined. Cook in the microwave until warm, 1 to 2 
                minutes; whisk again to dissolve sugar. Whisk in egg yolks and 
                vanilla until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour cream mixture into 2 ramekins set in a roasting pan. Pour 
                enough hot water into the pan to reach halfway up the sides of the 
                ramekins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set but slightly jiggly 
                in the center when shaken, about 50 minutes. Remove ramekins from 
                hot water and chill in the refrigerator until cold, at least 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over the top of each dessert. 
                Use a kitchen torch to melt and lightly toast sugar topping until 
                brown and bubbly, about 30 seconds. Let sugar topping cool to harden 
                before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
